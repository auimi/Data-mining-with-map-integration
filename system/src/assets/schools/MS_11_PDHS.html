                Kâ€“12 education in the Philippines covers kindergarten and 12 years of primary education to provide sufficient time for mastery of 
                concepts and skills, develop lifelong learners, and prepare graduates for tertiary education, middle-level skills development, employment, 
                and entrepreneurship. Education is compulsory for all children, and free public education is provided for pre-elementary, elementary, 
                and high school.
                <br><br>
                Schooling is divided into pre-elementary school, primary education, called elementary school, and secondary education, 
                divided into junior high school and senior high school.

                State universities and colleges (SUCs) refers to any public institution of higher learning that was created by an Act passed by the Congress of the Philippines. 
                These institutions are fully subsidized by the national government, and may be considered as a corporate body. SUCs are fully funded by the national government as 
                determined by the Philippine Congress. 
                <br><br>
                The University of the Philippines System, being the only national university, receives the biggest chunk of the budget among the 456 SUCs, and has likewise been 
                strengthened by law through Republic Act 9500.
